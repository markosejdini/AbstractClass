        -  next(), takes no parameters and returns the ListItem to its right.

        -  setNext(), takes a ListItem and sets it as its rightLink, then it returns rightLink.

        -  previous(), takes no parameters and returns the ListItem to its left.

        -  setPrevious(), takes a ListItem and sets it as its leftLink, then it returns leftLink.

        -  compareTo(), takes a ListItem and compares it to the ListItem that called this method. Use
         value from ListItem for comparison. If this value is greater than the value that was passed in,
         then it should return a number greater than zero. If vice versa, then it should return a number
         less than zero, and zero if equal. */
